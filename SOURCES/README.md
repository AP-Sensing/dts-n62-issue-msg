# IMPORTANT

This directory contains a self signed certificate and private key for the use within the dts nginx frontend and http gateway.
Those are only placeholder certificates and should not be used besides for the initial setup and as fallback in case the device gets reset.

Please take a look at the http frontend documentation for how to update those certificates with proper ones.
